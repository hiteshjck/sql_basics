The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
<ol>
<li>The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters</li>
<li>The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character</li>
</ol>
